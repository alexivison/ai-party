# Execution Core

Shared rules for all workflow skills. **Execution-core is opt-in** — the default session mode is direct editing with no workflow enforcement. These rules activate when a workflow skill (`task-workflow`, `bugfix-workflow`, `quick-fix-workflow`, `openspec-workflow`) opts the session into an execution preset. On Claude, the preset is also recorded for hook enforcement. On Codex and other agents without Claude's hook chain, the same preset is self-enforced from the agent doc and workflow skill. Bugfix-workflow omits source-file updates (no tracking files).

## Core Sequence

This section is the single source of truth for execution order across workflow docs.

```
/write-tests → implement → source-file updates → [code-critic + minimizer (+ requirements-auditor for task)] → companion review → commit → /pre-pr-verification → PR
```

Workflow skills enforce the critic-before-companion-review ordering. Claude hooks only record evidence and block self-approval — they do not gate sequencing. Agents without those hooks must self-enforce the same sequencing.

## Pre-Implementation Gate

**Before writing ANY code:**

1. **Create worktree** — `git worktree add ../repo-branch-name -b branch-name` (or `gwta` if available). One session per worktree; never `git checkout` in shared repos.
2. **Extract scope, requirements, and goal** from whatever triggered the work:
   - **Scope boundaries** (in scope / out of scope) — included in every sub-agent prompt
   - **Requirements** — concrete, verifiable items
   - **Goal** — one-line summary for review context

   Sources may include TASK files, external planning tool artifacts, or direct user instructions. Read the relevant source and extract the same three items regardless of format.
3. **Note tracking files** — If the work source has completion tracking (checkboxes, status markers), note the file locations for source-file updates later.
4. **Behavior change?** → Invoke `/write-tests` FIRST and capture RED evidence before implementing.
5. **Requirements unclear?** → Ask user.

State which items were checked before proceeding.

## RED Evidence Gate

For behavior-changing production code, tests are mandatory and must show RED→GREEN:

1. RED: failing test that demonstrates missing/incorrect behavior
2. GREEN: same test passing after implementation

No RED evidence for a behavior change is a blocking workflow violation.

## Feature Flag Gate

For behavior behind a feature flag, tests must prove both gate paths:

1. Flag ON: new behavior works as intended
2. Flag OFF: pre-implementation behavior remains unchanged

Missing OFF-path parity evidence is a blocking workflow violation.

## Minimality Gate

Before critics:

1. Record the "smallest possible fix" rationale (one line)
2. Remove speculative code and single-use abstractions without clear value
3. Avoid new dependencies unless strictly needed and justified
4. Compare `git diff --name-only` against the provided scope boundaries; out-of-scope touches require explicit justification

Out-of-scope touches without justification are blocking and require `NEEDS_DISCUSSION`.

## Source-File Updates

After implementation, if the work source has tracking files, keep them in sync:

1. **Files with checkboxes** (TASK*.md, PLAN.md, etc.): Update `- [ ]` → `- [x]` after implementation. Commit together with implementation.
2. **External tool tracking files**: Update completion markers per that tool's conventions. Commit together with implementation.
3. **No tracking files**: Skip this step entirely.

If task execution reveals the need to reorder or add tasks, update the tracking file explicitly before proceeding.

**Pre-filled checkbox prohibition:** Never write `- [x]` when creating new checklist items. All new items start as `- [ ]` and are only checked after the work is done and verified. Pre-filling checkboxes is falsifying evidence.

## Commit and PR Ordering

Create the commit before running `/pre-pr-verification`. The PR gate checks evidence against the committed diff_hash, so all evidence must be recorded after the commit exists.

**Re-run rule:** If you edit ANY implementation file after `/pre-pr-verification` passes, re-run before PR. Even a comment fix invalidates prior evidence (different diff_hash). Critics and companion-review evidence must also be fresh at the committed hash — if the commit changed the hash, re-run the cascade: critics → companion review → `/pre-pr-verification`.

## Evidence System

Evidence is always tied to the current committed `diff_hash`. Record which critics, companion review, and verification stages ran, together with their verdict/result, and treat any edit as stale evidence until those stages are re-run for the new hash.

Agent-specific hook plumbing, log files, metrics, and override knobs belong in agent-local docs. For Claude's implementation details, see `claude/rules/execution-core-claude-internals.md`.

## Opt-In Presets

Execution-core is **opt-in**. If no workflow skill is invoked, the session stays in direct-edit mode. A workflow skill opts the session into a preset, which drives the expected evidence requirements. On Claude, that preset also drives `pr-gate.sh`. On Codex, there is no local preset marker, so treat this table as a required checklist.

| Preset | Opt-in Skill | Sequence | Gate Evidence |
|--------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| _(none)_ | _(default)_ | direct editing | _(gate allows PR)_ |
| **task** | `task-workflow` | `/write-tests → implement → source-file updates → critics → companion review → commit → /pre-pr-verification → PR` | code-critic, minimizer, requirements-auditor, companion, pr-verified, test-runner, check-runner |
| **bugfix** | `bugfix-workflow` | `/write-tests (regression) → implement → critics → companion review → commit → /pre-pr-verification → PR` | code-critic, minimizer, companion, pr-verified, test-runner, check-runner |
| **quick** | `quick-fix-workflow` | `implement → code-critic → commit → /pre-pr-verification → PR` | code-critic, pr-verified, test-runner, check-runner |
| **spec** | `openspec-workflow` | `draft → CI spec-review → implement → CI ai-pr-review → PR` | pr-verified |

Claude writes `execution-preset = <name>` via `skill-marker.sh` when a workflow skill is invoked. Agents without Claude's hook chain do not write this marker locally; they still follow the same preset and evidence contract as self-enforced workflow rules.

Spec-review checks: atomicity, normative language (SHALL/MUST), testable scenarios (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN), non-overlapping requirements. Plan-review checks: architecture coherence, feasibility, completeness. Both follow review governance rules.

## Review Governance

Classify every finding before acting:

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Blocking** | Correctness bug, crash, security HIGH/CRITICAL | Fix + re-run |
| **Non-blocking** | Style, "could be simpler", defensive edge cases | Note only, do NOT re-run |
| **Out-of-scope** | Pre-existing untouched code, requirements not in scope | Reject |

**Issue ledger:** Track findings across iterations. Closed findings cannot be re-raised without new evidence. Critic reversing own feedback = oscillation — use own judgment, proceed.

**Lean loop:** Critics: two-pass mode (initial + one re-review). Companion happy-path: two passes, but continue until `VERDICT: APPROVED` regardless. `[q]`/`[nit]` are opt-in. Critics APPROVE when only non-blocking remain.

**Caps:** Critics: hard cap of 2 passes (initial + one re-review) → primary agent uses own judgment on any remaining blocking findings. **Companion: NO cap** — continue until APPROVED. Dispute with evidence if you disagree; never bypass. Non-blocking: 1 round → accept or drop.

**Tiered re-review:** One-symbol swap → test-runner only. Logic change → test-runner + critics. New export/signature/security path → full cascade.

**Scope enforcement:** Every sub-agent prompt MUST include the provided scope boundaries. Critics review the diff, not the codebase. Pre-existing code is non-blocking unless newly reachable.

## Decision Matrix

| Step | Outcome | Next |
|------|---------|------|
| /write-tests | Written (RED) | Implement |
| Implement | Done | Source-file updates |
| Minimality + Scope Gate | PASS / Scope violation | Critics / **PAUSE** (NEEDS_DISCUSSION) |
| Critics (code-critic, minimizer) | APPROVE or non-blocking only | Wait for others → companion review |
| Critics | REQUEST_CHANGES (blocking) | Fix batch + one re-run |
| Critics | Cap reached (2 passes) | Primary agent uses own judgment, proceed to companion review |
| All critics pass | — | Run companion review |
| Companion | APPROVE | Commit |
| Companion | REQUEST_CHANGES (blocking) | Fix + re-run critics + `--review` → `--review-complete`. **Repeat until APPROVED.** |
| Companion | REQUEST_CHANGES (non-blocking) | Record, proceed to commit |
| Companion | Out-of-scope or NEEDS_DISCUSSION | Dispute per § Dispute Resolution. **No cap — continue until resolved.** |
| Spec-review / Plan-review | Same pattern as critics | See § Opt-In Presets |
| Commit | Done | /pre-pr-verification |
| /pre-pr-verification | Pass/Fail | PR / fix |
| Edit/Write after approval | Evidence stale | Re-run cascade |

**Companion review is never a pause condition.** See § Pause Conditions for the full list of valid pause triggers.

## Dispute Resolution

**Critics:** No dispute rounds — after 2 passes, primary agent uses own judgment and proceeds.

**Companion disputes:** Write dispute context file (finding IDs + rationales), pass via `--dispute <file>`. No round cap — continue until the companion accepts or you concede. For NEEDS_DISCUSSION: debate via `--prompt` with evidence-based reasoning until genuine agreement. After resolution, dispatch fresh `--review` → `--review-complete` for gate evidence.

**Escalation to user:** Security-critical dispute, both agents agree human input needed, or genuinely circular (same arguments 3+ times, no new evidence).

## Pause Conditions & Sub-Agent Behavior

**Valid pause conditions:** Investigation findings, security-critical disagreement, oscillation, explicit blockers. Companion review is NEVER a pause condition.

**Sub-agent modes:** Investigation → always pause with findings. Verification (test/check) → never pause, summary only. Critics → 2 passes max, then primary agent decides. Companion → no cap, continue until APPROVED.

## Verification Principle

Evidence before claims. No assertions without proof (test output, file:line, grep result). Code edits invalidate prior evidence — rerun. Red flags: "should work", commit without checks, stale evidence.

**Always use your agent's verification mechanism** (see Stage Bindings in your top-level agent doc). Run tests and lint/typecheck through that mechanism — it discovers and runs the full suite. Verify checks before every push.

## PR Gate

On Claude, `pr-gate.sh` is the enforcement point. When no preset is set, it allows PR creation (opt-in default). When a preset is set, it requires the preset-specific evidence at the current diff_hash (see § Opt-In Presets for the preset-to-evidence mapping). Agents without the Claude hook chain do not run `pr-gate.sh`; they must self-enforce the same preset-specific checklist before PR or push.

**Post-PR:** Changes in same branch → re-run /pre-pr-verification → amend + force-push with `--force-with-lease`.

## Violation Patterns

| Pattern | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Behavior change without RED evidence | Block; add RED test first |
| Feature-flag without ON/OFF gate tests | Block; add gate tests first |
| Out-of-scope file changes without rationale | NEEDS_DISCUSSION |
| Add abstraction used once without clear gain | Remove or justify |
| Implement every finding without triage | Classify blocking/non-blocking/out-of-scope first |
| Stop after partial completion | Continue — never ask "should I continue?" |
| Chase non-blocking nits 2+ rounds | Triage, note, move on |
| Edit after approval, then PR | Evidence stale — re-run cascade |
| Approve without `--review-complete` | Gate blocks — run review first |
| Evidence created outside authorized paths | Forbidden — only hooks/workflow skills write evidence |
| Companion review bypassed or declared "done" without APPROVED | FORBIDDEN — no iteration cap |
| Lint/typecheck bypassing the agent's verification mechanism | Always run through the configured mechanism |
| Push without fresh check evidence | Run full verification before every push |
| Dependency added without lockfile | Stage lockfile in same commit |
| Spec PR without spec-review + plan-review | Block; run spec preset cascade first |
| Spec preset PR containing production code | Block; use task preset instead |
