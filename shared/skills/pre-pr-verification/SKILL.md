# Pre-PR Verification

Run all checks locally before creating a PR. No PR without passing verification.

## Core Principle

**"Evidence before PR, always."** — If you haven't run verification fresh and seen it pass, you cannot create a PR.

## Ordering — Run AFTER Commit

The PR gate checks evidence against the current **committed** `diff_hash`. Re-running verification on an uncommitted diff and then committing invalidates the evidence the gate will check, and you'll have to re-run anyway. Sequence:

```
… → commit → /pre-pr-verification → gh pr create
```

Any edit (even a comment fix) after verification passes also invalidates evidence — re-run before pushing. Verification does not replace any required companion-review evidence; it only refreshes the test/check half of the PR gate.

## Process

### Step 1 — DO THIS NOW: Run Your Full Verification

Run both the test suite and the static checks (typecheck, lint). This is the primary action of this skill; everything else supports it.

Your top-level agent doc binds `pre-pr-verification` to a concrete mechanism (see "Stage Bindings" in `claude/CLAUDE.md` or `codex/AGENTS.md`). Dispatch both halves in parallel whenever the mechanism supports it so the verification finishes in a single round.

The mechanism must auto-discover the repo's test, lint, and typecheck commands — no need to pre-identify them. Wait for both halves to finish, then review the summaries.

**If you need more detail:** re-run the specific failing test/check directly to see full output.

### Step 2: Handle Failures

**If checks fail on NEW code you wrote:**
1. Fix the issue
2. Re-run ALL checks (not just the failing one)
3. Repeat until all pass

**If checks fail on UNRELATED code:**
1. Don't rationalize "it's not my change"
2. Either fix it (if simple) or ask user how to proceed
3. Never ship a PR with known failures

**If a test is flaky** (passes/fails randomly):
1. A flaky test is a broken test — don't ignore it
2. If you can't fix it: file an issue, skip the test explicitly with a comment, document in PR
3. Never ship with unskipped flaky tests

### Step 3: Capture Evidence

After all checks pass, capture the output for the PR description:

```markdown
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Typecheck | ✓ No errors |
| Lint | ✓ No errors (X warnings) |
| Tests | ✓ X passed, 0 failed |

Run at: [timestamp]
```

Include this in the PR description so reviewers know verification was done.

## Red Flags — STOP

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Should pass" (without fresh evidence)
- "I'll fix that after the PR"
- "That failure is unrelated"
- "It's a small change, no need to verify"

**STOP.** Run verification. Show evidence.

## Only After Passing

Create or update the PR.
