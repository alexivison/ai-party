description: >-
  Dispatch the configured companion agent to review the current changes for
  correctness, bugs, and guideline compliance, and record the verdict. Produces
  a structured report with severity-labeled findings ([must]/[q]/[nit]) and a
  single APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES/NEEDS_DISCUSSION verdict. Also loaded by the
  code-critic agent for SRP, DRY, and correctness checks. Locality, simplicity,
  and bloat are handled by the minimizer agent separately.

# Companion Review — Correctness

Review the current changes for correctness, bugs, and structural quality. Identify issues only — don't implement fixes.

Workflows invoke this skill to dispatch the configured companion and record its approval. When reviewing locally, follow the same contract: gather evidence, apply the principles below, and emit a verdict using the output format at the bottom.

## Reference Documentation

Reference files live under this skill's `reference/` directory, accessible via your agent-local symlink (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/companion-review/reference/...` or `~/.codex/skills/companion-review/reference/...`):

- **General**: `companion-review/reference/general.md` — SRP, DRY, thresholds, quality checklist
- **Frontend**: `companion-review/reference/frontend.md` — React, TypeScript, CSS, testing patterns

Load relevant reference docs based on what's being reviewed.

## Principles (this skill's scope)

1. **SRP** — Single Responsibility: one reason to change per unit
2. **DRY** — Don't Repeat Yourself: single source of truth *(respects locality — prefer same-file extraction)*

Locality (LoB), simplicity (KISS), and bloat (YAGNI) are the minimizer's domain. Do not duplicate that work.

Severity labels (`[must]`/`[q]`/`[nit]`) and verdicts: see `shared/reference/severity-verdict.md`.

## Process

1. Use `git diff` to see staged/unstaged changes
2. Check SRP and DRY against the diff
3. Check for bugs, regressions, missing tests, security issues
4. Review against language-specific guidelines in reference documentation
5. Be specific with file:line references
6. Tag each finding with the violated principle (e.g., `[SRP]`, `[DRY]`)
7. Explain WHY something is an issue (not just what's wrong)

## Output Format

```
## Code Review Report

### Summary
One paragraph: what's good, what needs work.

### Must Fix
- **file.ts:42** - Brief description of critical issue
- **file.ts:55-60** - Another critical issue

### Questions
- **file.ts:78** - Question that needs clarification

### Nits
- **file.ts:90** - Minor improvement suggestion

### Verdict
Exactly ONE of: **APPROVE** or **REQUEST_CHANGES** or **NEEDS_DISCUSSION**
One sentence explanation.

The verdict line must contain exactly one verdict keyword. Never include multiple verdict keywords in the same response — hooks parse the last occurrence to record evidence, and mixed verdicts cause false gate blocks.
```

## Example

```
## Code Review Report

### Summary
The changes improve error handling and logging. Need to fix a missing null check and clarify a validation approach.

### Must Fix
- **api.ts:34-45** - [SRP] Handler is doing validation + serialization + error formatting — split into focused functions
- **api.ts:80** - Missing null check on response.data before accessing properties

### Questions
- **auth.ts:78** - [DRY] Why duplicate validation here instead of reusing middleware?

### Nits
- **config.ts:5** - Import order (external packages first)

### Verdict
**REQUEST_CHANGES** - Must fix the null check and split the oversized handler.
