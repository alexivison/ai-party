# Evidence Log Migration + Quick-Fix Skill + skill-eval Removal

## Context

The current PR gate system uses 7 marker files in `/tmp/` to track workflow completion state. When code is edited, `marker-invalidate.sh` deletes all markers, forcing full re-review. This works but has problems:
- Marker files are fragile (race conditions, no audit trail, no metadata)
- Invalidation is all-or-nothing (editing one file wipes all evidence)
- No way to implement tiered gates (small fixes requiring fewer checks)
- Adding the quick-fix-workflow skill requires a lighter gate path

**Solution:** Replace marker files with a single JSONL evidence log per session. Each entry records a `diff_hash` (SHA-256 of the branch diff from merge-base). Gate hooks compute the current diff hash and only accept evidence with a matching hash. This eliminates `marker-invalidate.sh` entirely — stale evidence is automatically ignored.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create shared evidence library
**New file: `claude/hooks/lib/evidence.sh`**

Sourced by all writer/reader hooks. Functions:

- `evidence_file(session_id)` → `/tmp/claude-evidence-${session_id}.jsonl`
- `compute_diff_hash(cwd)` → SHA-256 of the **full working-tree diff** from merge-base:
  ```
  git diff $(git merge-base $default_branch HEAD) -- . ':!*.md' ':!*.log' ':!*.jsonl' ':!*.tmp'
  ```
  Note: no `..HEAD` — this hashes committed branch changes **plus** staged and unstaged edits in one pass. Any uncommitted edit to an implementation file changes the hash, automatically invalidating prior evidence.
  - Returns `"clean"` if merge-base equals HEAD **and** working tree is clean (no diff output)
  - Returns `"unknown"` if not a git repo or cwd missing
  - Detects default branch (main vs master)
- `append_evidence(session_id, type, result, cwd)` → acquires `flock` on `/tmp/claude-evidence-${session_id}.lock`, computes diff_hash, appends JSONL line, releases lock. Single-line JSONL writes are typically atomic under `PIPE_BUF`, but `flock` guarantees correctness when parallel sub-agents (e.g. code-critic + minimizer) complete simultaneously.
- `check_evidence(session_id, type, cwd)` → returns 0 if matching type+diff_hash exists
- `check_all_evidence(session_id, types_string, cwd)` → checks multiple types, outputs missing ones to stdout
- `diff_stats(cwd)` → outputs `lines files new_files` for tiered gate decisions

### Step 2: Create evidence library tests
**New file: `claude/hooks/tests/test-evidence.sh`**

Tests in a temp git repo (mktemp -d, git init, trap cleanup):
- `compute_diff_hash` consistency, change detection, .md exclusion, clean state
- `compute_diff_hash` changes on uncommitted edit (staged-only, unstaged-only, untracked excluded)
- `compute_diff_hash` changes when merge-base == HEAD but working tree is dirty
- `append_evidence` creates valid JSONL
- `append_evidence` concurrent writes preserve valid JSONL (stress test: 20 parallel appends, verify line count + JSON validity)
- `check_evidence` matches/rejects on diff_hash and type
- `check_all_evidence` returns missing types
- `diff_stats` returns correct counts

### Step 3a: Migrate `agent-trace-stop.sh`
**Modify: `claude/hooks/agent-trace-stop.sh` (lines 94-112)**

- Add `source "$(dirname "$0")/lib/evidence.sh"` after line 13
- Replace 4 `touch` blocks with `append_evidence` calls
- Verdict detection (lines 30-68) and trace logging (lines 70-92) unchanged

### Step 3b: Migrate `codex-trace.sh`
**Modify: `claude/hooks/codex-trace.sh` (lines 54-72)**

- Add `source` of evidence.sh
- Extract `cwd` from hook input
- Replace `touch` with `append_evidence` for codex-ran and codex types
- Replace `[ -f marker ]` prerequisite check with `check_evidence` for codex-ran

### Step 3c: Migrate `skill-marker.sh`
**Modify: `claude/hooks/skill-marker.sh` (lines 25-29)**

- Add `source` of evidence.sh
- Extract `CWD` from input
- Replace `touch` with `append_evidence` for pr-verified type

### Step 4a: Migrate `pr-gate.sh` with tiered gate
**Modify: `claude/hooks/pr-gate.sh` (lines 46-73)**

- Add `source` of evidence.sh
- Keep docs-only bypass (lines 27-44) as-is
- After docs-only check, compute diff_stats
- **Tiered gate:** if `lines ≤ 30 AND files ≤ 3 AND new_files == 0` → require only `test-runner check-runner`
- **Full gate:** otherwise → require `pr-verified code-critic minimizer codex test-runner check-runner`
- Use `check_all_evidence` to find missing types
- Same deny JSON format as current

### Step 4b: Migrate `codex-gate.sh`
**Modify: `claude/hooks/codex-gate.sh` (lines 27-70)**

- Add `source` of evidence.sh
- Extract `CWD` from input
- Replace `[ -f marker ]` checks with `check_evidence`/`check_all_evidence`

### Step 5: Update existing tests
**Modify: `claude/hooks/tests/test-agent-trace.sh`**
- Replace marker file assertions (`[ -f /tmp/claude-* ]`) with JSONL grep checks
- Setup: create temp git repo for diff_hash computation, pass as cwd in test inputs
- Cleanup: remove evidence JSONL files

**Modify: `claude/hooks/tests/test-codex-trace.sh`**
- Same pattern: replace `touch`/`[ -f ]` with `append_evidence`/JSONL grep
- Temp git repo setup for cwd
- Workflow simulation: evidence log instead of marker files

**Modify: `claude/hooks/tests/test-codex-gate.sh`**
- Replace `touch` marker setup with `append_evidence` calls
- Temp git repo for diff_hash

### Step 6: Create PR gate tests
**New file: `claude/hooks/tests/test-pr-gate.sh`**

- Full gate: blocks when evidence missing, allows when all present
- Full gate: blocks on stale diff_hash
- Tiered gate: small diff needs only test-runner + check-runner
- Tiered gate: large diff (>30 lines) requires full evidence
- Tiered gate: new files require full evidence
- Docs-only bypass still works

### Step 7: Remove obsolete hooks and wiring
**Modify: `claude/settings.json`**
- Remove `Edit|Write` PostToolUse entry (marker-invalidate.sh) — lines 155-163
- Remove `UserPromptSubmit` entry (skill-eval.sh) — lines 85-93

**Delete: `claude/hooks/marker-invalidate.sh`**
**Delete: `claude/hooks/tests/test-marker-invalidate.sh`**
**Delete: `claude/hooks/skill-eval.sh`**

### Step 8: Update session cleanup
**Modify: `claude/hooks/session-cleanup.sh`**
- Add `find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name "claude-evidence-*.jsonl" -mtime +1 -delete`
- Keep old marker cleanup for transition

### Step 9: Update execution-core.md and CLAUDE.md for tiered workflows
**Modify: `claude/rules/execution-core.md`**
- Add a **Tiered Execution** section after the Core Sequence defining two tiers:
  - **Full tier** (default): current sequence unchanged (`/write-tests → implement → ... → PR`)
  - **Quick tier**: for non-behavioral changes only (config, docs-with-code, dependency bumps, typo fixes, CI tweaks). Sequence: `implement → test-runner → check-runner → PR`. Explicitly forbidden for: new features, bug fixes, logic changes, API changes, security-relevant changes.
- Amend the RED Evidence Gate to say: "For behavior-changing production code **under the full execution tier**..."
- Amend the PR Gate to document both tiers' required evidence types

**Modify: `claude/CLAUDE.md`**
- Update Workflow Selection to replace `skill-eval.sh` reference with SKILL.md frontmatter routing
- Add `quick-fix-workflow` to the selection table with scope constraints

### Step 10: Create quick-fix-workflow skill
**New file: `claude/skills/quick-fix-workflow/SKILL.md`**

Frontmatter: name, description, user-invocable: true

**Scope constraints (enforced, not advisory):**
- ONLY for non-behavioral changes: config, dependency bumps, typo/comment fixes, CI/build tweaks, docs-with-code
- If the change modifies runtime logic, control flow, API surface, or security-relevant code → reject and suggest task-workflow or bugfix-workflow
- Size guardrail: >30 lines / >3 files / new files → reject

Flow:
1. Pre-gate: working tree must be clean (or use --worktree)
2. Scope check: verify change is non-behavioral (reject otherwise)
3. Implement the change
4. Size guardrail: compute diff stats, reject if over threshold
5. Run test-runner sub-agent
6. Run check-runner sub-agent
7. Commit and create PR (tiered gate allows this)

Non-goals: no RED phase (not applicable — non-behavioral), no critics, no codex, no adversarial review, no pre-pr-verification

## Dependency Order

```
Step 1 (evidence.sh)
  ↓
Step 2 (test-evidence.sh)        ← verify foundation

Steps 3a, 3b, 3c (writers)      ← parallel
  ↓
Steps 4a, 4b (readers)          ← parallel
  ↓
Steps 5, 6 (test updates)       ← parallel

Step 7 (remove old hooks)
  ↓
Step 8 (cleanup)
  ↓
Step 9 (update execution-core.md + CLAUDE.md)  ← before skill creation

Step 10 (quick-fix-workflow skill)
```

## Verification

1. Run `bash ~/.claude/hooks/tests/run-all.sh` — all tests pass
2. Manual: simulate agent-trace-stop with code-critic APPROVED → check JSONL entry exists with diff_hash
3. Manual: make an **uncommitted** edit to an implementation file → verify diff_hash changes → old evidence ignored by gate
4. Manual: make a **staged-only** edit → verify diff_hash changes
5. Manual: test tiered gate with small non-behavioral diff → only test-runner + check-runner required
6. Manual: test full gate with large diff → all 6 evidence types required
7. Manual: test concurrent sub-agent completion → JSONL remains valid (no corrupted lines)
