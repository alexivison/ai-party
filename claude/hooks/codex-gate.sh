# Wizard Review Gate Hook
# Hard-blocks deprecated --approve flag on transport commands — workers cannot self-approve.
# Wizard approval flows through review-complete (verdict in findings file).
# All other transport commands (review, prompt, plan-review, review-complete)
# pass through freely. Workflow skills enforce critic-to-Wizard sequencing;
# this hook only enforces the self-approval block.
#
# Triggered: PreToolUse on Bash tool
# Fails open on errors (cannot determine session_id or command → allow)
