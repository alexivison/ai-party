# Execution Core

Shared rules for all workflow skills. Applies to all implementation regardless of planning source. Bugfix-workflow omits source-file updates (no tracking files).

## Core Sequence

This section is the single source of truth for execution order across workflow docs.

```
/write-tests → implement → source-file updates → [code-critic + minimizer (+ scribe when requirements provided)] → codex [+ sentinel] → /pre-pr-verification → commit → PR
```

Workflow skills enforce the critic-before-Codex ordering. Hooks only record evidence and block self-approval — they do not gate sequencing. Sentinel runs after critics pass. Advisory only — no gating markers.

## RED Evidence Gate

For behavior-changing production code, tests are mandatory and must show RED→GREEN:

1. RED: failing test that demonstrates missing/incorrect behavior
2. GREEN: same test passing after implementation

No RED evidence for a behavior change is a blocking workflow violation.

## Feature Flag Gate

For behavior behind a feature flag, tests must prove both gate paths:

1. Flag ON: new behavior works as intended
2. Flag OFF: pre-implementation behavior remains unchanged

Missing OFF-path parity evidence is a blocking workflow violation.

## Minimality Gate

Before critics:

1. Record the "smallest possible fix" rationale (one line)
2. Remove speculative code and single-use abstractions without clear value
3. Avoid new dependencies unless strictly needed and justified
4. Compare `git diff --name-only` against the provided scope boundaries; out-of-scope touches require explicit justification

Out-of-scope touches without justification are blocking and require `NEEDS_DISCUSSION`.

## Evidence System

Evidence is stored in a per-session JSONL log (`/tmp/claude-evidence-{session_id}.jsonl`). Each entry records a `diff_hash` — SHA-256 of the branch diff from merge-base. Gate hooks compute the current diff_hash and only accept evidence with a matching hash. Editing code after approval automatically invalidates prior evidence (different hash) — no invalidation hook needed.

`codex-gate.sh` only blocks `party-cli transport approve` (self-approval). All other transport commands (`review`, `prompt`, `plan-review`, `review-complete`) pass through freely. Workflow skills are responsible for running critics before dispatching Codex review. `--approve` is hard-blocked; approval flows through `--review-complete` reading the verdict Codex wrote.

`agent-trace-stop.sh` tracks all critic verdicts (APPROVED and REQUEST_CHANGES) via `{type}-run` evidence entries and detects oscillation in two modes:
- **Same-hash alternation** (all critics including scribe): when 3 alternating verdicts are detected at the same hash (e.g., RC→A→RC), an auto-triage-override is recorded.
- **Cross-hash repeated findings** (minimizer only): when the same normalized REQUEST_CHANGES body appears across 3+ distinct hashes, an auto-triage-override is recorded. Code-critic is exempt — correctness bugs legitimately persist across fix attempts.

## Review Metrics

Review effectiveness metrics are tracked in persistent per-session JSONL logs (`~/.claude/logs/review-metrics/{session_id}.jsonl`). The metrics capture the full lifecycle of review findings for long-term analysis of reviewer quality and Claude's triage accuracy.

**Events tracked:**
- `finding_raised` — A reviewer produced a finding (source, severity, category, file, line, description)
- `findings_summary` — Aggregate counts per reviewer pass (total, blocking, non-blocking, verdict)
- `triage` — Claude classified a finding (blocking/non-blocking/out-of-scope → fix/noted/dismissed/debate)
- `resolved` — A finding reached its final state (fixed/dismissed/debated/overridden/accepted/escalated)
- `review_cycle` — End-of-cycle summary with cumulative stats

**Automatic recording** (via hooks):
- `agent-trace-stop.sh` records `findings_summary` for code-critic, minimizer, scribe, and sentinel by parsing `[must]`/`[should]`/`[nit]` tags and `**BLOCKING**`/`**NON-BLOCKING**` markers from agent responses.
- `codex-trace.sh` records individual `finding_raised` entries and a `findings_summary` by parsing the TOON findings file when `--review-complete` runs.

**Manual recording** (via CLI during triage):
```bash
# Record triage decision
~/.claude/hooks/scripts/review-metrics.sh --triage <session> <finding_id> <source> <classification> <action> [rationale]

# Record resolution
~/.claude/hooks/scripts/review-metrics.sh --resolved <session> <finding_id> <source> <resolution> [cwd] [detail]

# Record end of review cycle
~/.claude/hooks/scripts/review-metrics.sh --cycle <session> <cycle_number> [cwd]
```

**Querying:**
```bash
# Human-readable report for a session
~/.claude/hooks/scripts/review-metrics.sh --report <session>

# JSON export for programmatic analysis
~/.claude/hooks/scripts/review-metrics.sh --export <session>

# Report across all sessions
~/.claude/hooks/scripts/review-metrics.sh --report-all
```

**Key metrics derived:** fix rate, dismiss rate, override rate, per-source finding counts, triage classification breakdown, resolution distribution. Use these to assess: how often reviewers catch real bugs, how often Claude ignores findings, and which reviewers produce the most actionable feedback.

## Tiered Execution

- **Full tier** (default): current sequence unchanged (`/write-tests → implement → ... → PR`). Gate-enforced evidence: pr-verified, code-critic, minimizer, codex, test-runner, check-runner. Scribe is workflow-enforced by task-workflow (not gate-enforced) — it runs when requirements are provided but bugfix-workflow has no requirements source, so scribe cannot be a universal gate requirement.
- **Quick tier**: requires explicit `quick-tier` evidence from the quick-fix-workflow skill (size alone is insufficient). For non-behavioral changes only (config, deps, typos, CI). Sequence: `implement → code-critic → test-runner → check-runner → PR`. Required evidence: quick-tier, code-critic, test-runner, check-runner. Size limit: ≤30 changed lines (additions + deletions), ≤3 files, 0 new files. Explicitly forbidden for: new features, bug fixes, logic changes, API changes, security-relevant changes.

## Review Governance

Classify every finding before acting:

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Blocking** | Correctness bug, crash, security HIGH/CRITICAL | Fix + re-run |
| **Non-blocking** | Style, "could be simpler", defensive edge cases | Note only, do NOT re-run |
| **Out-of-scope** | Pre-existing untouched code, requirements not in scope | Reject |

**Issue ledger:** Track findings across iterations. Closed findings cannot be re-raised without new evidence. Critic reversing own feedback = oscillation — use own judgment, proceed.

**Lean loop default:**
- Critics run in two-pass mode: initial pass, then one re-review pass after fixing blocking items.
- Codex happy-path is two passes (initial + one re-review), but this is NOT a stopping rule — continue until `VERDICT: APPROVED` regardless of pass count.
- `[q]` and `[nit]` are opt-in (only when explicitly requested). By default, suppress them.
- Critics should return `APPROVE` when only non-blocking findings remain.

**Caps:** Blocking critics: max 3 critic iterations, then dispute resolution (2 rounds) before escalating to user. **Codex has NO iteration cap** — you MUST continue the review loop (fix → re-review, or dispute via `--prompt`) until Codex writes `VERDICT: APPROVED`. You may NOT decide the Codex review phase is "done" while the verdict is still `REQUEST_CHANGES` or `NEEDS_DISCUSSION`. If you believe Codex is wrong, dispute with evidence — do not bypass. Escalate to user only when both agents explicitly agree they need human input, or a security-critical finding is disputed. Non-blocking: max 1 round → accept or drop.

**Tiered re-review:** One-symbol swap → test-runner only. Logic change → test-runner + critics. New export/signature/security path → full cascade.

**Scope enforcement:** Every sub-agent prompt MUST include the provided scope boundaries. Critics review the diff, not the codebase. Pre-existing code is non-blocking unless newly reachable.

## Decision Matrix

| Step | Outcome | Next | Pause? |
|------|---------|------|--------|
| /write-tests | Written (RED) | Implement | NO |
| Implement | Done | Source-file updates | NO |
| Minimality + Scope Gate | PASS | Critics | NO |
| Minimality + Scope Gate | Scope violation w/o justification | NEEDS_DISCUSSION | YES |
| code-critic, minimizer, or scribe | APPROVE | Wait for others / codex | NO |
| code-critic, minimizer, or scribe | REQUEST_CHANGES (blocking) | Fix in one batch + one re-run of all three | NO |
| code-critic, minimizer, or scribe | REQUEST_CHANGES (non-blocking) | Record and treat as effective APPROVE (LLM misclassified) | NO |
| code-critic, minimizer, or scribe | NEEDS_DISCUSSION / oscillation / cap | Dispute resolution: re-run with context explaining dismissed findings (2 rounds) → escalate to user if unresolved | NO (until dispute cap) |
| All three critics done, no blocking | — | Run codex | NO |
| codex | APPROVE | /pre-pr-verification | NO |
| codex | REQUEST_CHANGES (blocking) | Fix in one batch + commit + re-run critics + new `--review` → `--review-complete`. **Repeat until APPROVED.** Escalate per § Escalation criteria if circular. | NO |
| codex | REQUEST_CHANGES (non-blocking) | Record and proceed to /pre-pr-verification | NO |
| codex | REQUEST_CHANGES with out-of-scope findings | Dismiss with rationale in dispute context file → re-review. If Codex still disagrees, debate via `--prompt` with evidence. **Continue until Codex concedes or approves.** Escalate per § Escalation criteria if circular or security-critical. | NO |
| codex | NEEDS_DISCUSSION | Debate via `--prompt` with evidence-based reasoning. Codex may concede, counter-argue, or propose compromise. **Continue discussion until resolved** (one agent concedes or compromise reached). Escalate per § Escalation criteria if circular or security-critical. | NO |
| sentinel | Any findings | Paladin triages (advisory, no gating markers) | NO |
| sentinel | Timeout | Proceed with Codex findings only | NO |
| /pre-pr-verification | Pass/Fail | PR / fix | NO |
| Edit/Write (impl) | Evidence stale (diff_hash changed) | Re-run cascade | NO |

## Dispute Resolution

When critics or Codex return NEEDS_DISCUSSION or raise out-of-scope findings, agents resolve the disagreement before escalating to the user.

**Critic disputes:** Re-run the critic with updated prompt context explaining which findings are out-of-scope and why. The critic sees the rationale and either accepts (APPROVE) or raises new evidence. Max 2 dispute rounds per critic.

**Codex out-of-scope disputes:** Write a dispute context file listing dismissed finding IDs and rationales. Pass via `--dispute <file>` to `--review`. Codex reads the file, accepts valid dismissals, challenges invalid ones with file:line evidence. **No round cap** — continue disputing until Codex accepts the dismissals or you concede and fix the findings. If Codex provides compelling file:line evidence against a dismissal, concede that finding and fix it.

**Codex NEEDS_DISCUSSION:** Formulate a position (concede, counter-argue, or propose compromise) and send via `--prompt`. Codex responds with evidence-based reasoning. **Continue the discussion** — do not abandon it after a fixed number of rounds. Each exchange should make progress: concede valid points, counter with evidence, or propose concrete compromises. The goal is genuine agreement, not attrition.

**After successful dispute resolution:** If the dispute concludes that the work should proceed, dispatch a fresh `--review` → `--review-complete` to satisfy the gate evidence requirements.

**Escalation criteria (user involvement):**
- Security-critical finding is disputed
- Both agents explicitly agree they need human input
- Discussion is genuinely circular (same arguments repeated verbatim 3+ times with no new evidence from either side)

## Valid Pause Conditions

Investigation findings, critic dispute cap reached (2 rounds unresolved), security-critical disagreement, oscillation, explicit blockers. **Codex review is NOT a valid pause condition** — continue until `VERDICT: APPROVED` or mutual escalation.

## Sub-Agent Behavior

Investigation (codex debug): always pause, show full findings. Verification (test/check): never pause, summary only. Iterative critics: enter dispute resolution on NEEDS_DISCUSSION/cap; pause only on dispute cap reached, oscillation, or security-critical disagreement. **Iterative codex: no cap — continue fix/dispute loop until `VERDICT: APPROVED`.** Pause only on security-critical disagreement or mutual agreement that human input is needed.

## Verification Principle

Evidence before claims. No assertions without proof (test output, file:line, grep result). Code edits invalidate prior evidence — rerun. Red flags: "should work", commit without checks, stale evidence.

**Always use sub-agents for verification.** Use `test-runner` for tests and `check-runner` for lint/typecheck. Never run partial checks via Bash directly — sub-agents discover and run the full suite. Run `check-runner` before every push.

## PR Gate

Code PRs require all evidence at the current diff_hash. The PR gate (`pr-gate.sh`) is the single enforcement point — no other hook gates sequencing. Full tier: pr-verified, code-critic, minimizer, codex, test-runner, check-runner (scribe is enforced by task-workflow when requirements are provided, not by the gate — bugfix-workflow has no requirements source). Quick tier (requires explicit quick-tier evidence + size limits): quick-tier, code-critic, test-runner, check-runner. Evidence created by `agent-trace-stop.sh`, `codex-trace.sh`, `skill-marker.sh`, and workflow skills (e.g., `quick-fix-workflow` writes `quick-tier`).

**Post-PR:** Changes in same branch → re-run /pre-pr-verification → amend + force-push with `--force-with-lease`.

## Violation Patterns

| Pattern | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Behavior change without RED evidence | Block; add RED test first |
| Feature-flag change without ON/OFF gate tests (including OFF-path parity) | Block; add gate tests first |
| Out-of-scope file changes without rationale | Stop with NEEDS_DISCUSSION |
| Add abstraction used once without clear gain | Remove or justify |
| Stop after partial completion | Continue — don't ask "should I continue?" |
| Chase non-blocking nits 2+ rounds | Triage, note, move on |
| Implement every finding without triage | Classify blocking/non-blocking/out-of-scope first |
| Full cascade after one-line fix | Tiered re-review |
| Approve without --review-complete | Gate blocks — run review first |
| Edit after approval, then PR | Evidence stale (diff_hash changed) — re-run |
| Create evidence outside authorized paths | Forbidden — only hooks and workflow skills write evidence via `append_evidence` |
| Fourth critic round on same diff | Enter dispute resolution (2 rounds) → escalate to user if unresolved |
| Deciding Codex review is "done" without APPROVED | FORBIDDEN — continue fix/dispute loop until Codex writes `VERDICT: APPROVED` |
| Bypassing Codex after N iterations | FORBIDDEN — there is no iteration cap for Codex. Keep engaging. |
| Run lint/typecheck via Bash instead of check-runner | Always delegate to sub-agents — they run the full suite |
| Push without running check-runner | Run check-runner before every push, no exceptions |
| Add dependency without committing lockfile | Stage lockfile in same commit as package.json change |
