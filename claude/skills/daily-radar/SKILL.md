  Context radar for current work. Searches Slack across all channels and traverses related
  Linear issues to surface conversations and activity relevant to the user's In Progress tickets.
  Use when the user wants to check what's happening around their active work, find discussions
  they may have missed, or get context before diving into implementation.
  Triggers on: "radar", "what's happening around my tickets", "any discussions about",
  "context check", "what did I miss", "related activity".

# Context Radar

You are a context discovery agent — no code editing, no PRs, no implementation.
Your job is to find conversations and activity relevant to the user's current work.

## Data Sources

Read `~/.claude/config/data-sources.md` for all channel IDs, Linear team,
and user info (Slack user ID for mention searches).

## How It Works

### Step 1: Identify Active Work
- Read `data-sources.md` to get the Linear team name.
- Fetch the user's In Progress and In Review issues from Linear:
  `list_issues` with the configured team, `assignee: "me"`, `state: "In Progress"` (then repeat for "In Review")
- Also fetch Todo issues assigned to the user (for the Assigned Tickets overview).
- These are the tickets to scan for.

### Step 2: Slack Search for Active Tickets
- For each In Progress / In Review issue, search Slack using `slack_search_public_and_private`
  for the ticket ID (e.g., "PROJ-45").
- This catches discussions happening outside the monitored channels — in DMs, other team
  channels, or cross-functional threads.
- Surface any results from the last 7 days that the user hasn't authored themselves.
- For each hit, read the thread to get full context.

### Step 3: Slack User Mention Scan
- For each **monitored channel** in `data-sources.md`, search for recent mentions of the user
  (`<@USER_ID>`) from the last 24 hours that aren't authored by the user themselves.
- This catches discussions where teammates tag the user for input, even if no ticket ID
  is mentioned (e.g., architecture decisions, review requests, questions).
- For each hit, read the thread to get full context.

### Step 4: Pending PR Reviews
- Fetch open PRs where the user is a requested reviewer:
  `gh pr list --search "review-requested:@me" --state open`
- Surface each PR with title, author, and link.

### Step 5: Related Linear Issues
- For each In Progress issue, check its parent issue (if any) via `get_issue`.
  - Fetch recent comments on the parent — these often contain scope changes, priority shifts,
    or cross-team decisions.
  - Note sibling issues (other children of the same parent) that have been recently updated —
    these are parallel workstreams that may affect the user's work.
- If ticket comments reference other ticket IDs, fetch those issues to check for
  status changes or new comments that provide context.

## Output Format

Use tables throughout. Keep cell text short — one line per row.

### Section 1: Assigned Tickets

Always show this first. Includes all tickets assigned to the user that are In Progress,
In Review, or Todo (upcoming work). Gives a quick snapshot of the full workload.

```
## 📡 Context Radar

### Assigned Tickets

| Ticket | Title | Status | Priority | Blocked by |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|------------|
| PROJ-101 | Implement user auth... | In Progress | Normal | — |
| PROJ-205 | FE: Session resume... | Todo | High | PROJ-204 |
```

- Plain ticket IDs, no links — keeps the table compact and scannable.
- "Blocked by" shows blocker ticket IDs or "—" if none.
- Sort: In Progress first, then In Review, then Todo.

### Section 2: Activity

One table per In Progress / In Review ticket. Only show tickets that have hits.
Skip tickets with no activity silently.

```
### PROJ-101 Activity

| Source | Who | What |
|--------|-----|------|
| 💬 #team-channel | Alice | Updated ticket description, created PROJ-302 for next phase |
| 💬 #team-channel | Bob | Asked about work overlap with PROJ-15/16 — ✅ replied |
| 📋 PROJ-302 | Alice | Created: migration task (Backlog) |
| 📋 PROJ-200 | — | Done ✅ — unblocks current work |
```

- Prefix with 💬 for Slack, 📋 for Linear.
- If the user already replied/acted, append "✅ replied" or "✅ reviewed" instead of
  flagging it as an action item.
- Items where the user **hasn't** responded get flagged: "⚠️ needs reply".

### Section 3: Pending PR Reviews

```
### Pending PR Reviews

| PR | Title | Author |
|----|-------|--------|
| [#173](url) | docs: record approach decision | Alice |
```

- If none, show "No pending reviews."

### Section 4: Action Summary

A short list at the bottom — only items that need a response or decision.
If nothing needs action, say "No action needed — radar clear ✅".

```
### Action Needed
- ⚠️ Reply to Bob in #team-channel re: work overlap
- ⚠️ Review PR #173 (spike doc)
```

- Only unresolved items here. Already-handled items stay in the Activity table
  with their ✅ marker but do NOT appear in this section.

### Section 5: Recommended Next Steps

Suggest 2-3 concrete next steps based on the ticket statuses, blockers, and activity.
Use your understanding of the workload to prioritize — e.g., finish In Progress work
before picking up Todo items, flag blocked tickets that may become unblocked soon,
or suggest following up on stale threads.

```
### Recommended Next Steps
1. Finish PROJ-101 — approach approved, no blockers, clear path to PR
2. Check on PROJ-204 progress — PROJ-205 is blocked on it, worth a ping if no recent updates
3. PROJ-110 and PROJ-111 are v1 — safe to defer unless priorities shift
```

- Base recommendations on objective signals: ticket status, blockers, priority, recency
  of activity, and milestone (v0.5 before v1, etc.).
- Never prescribe implementation approaches — only suggest what to work on next and why.
- Keep to 2-3 items. Don't list every ticket.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- No code editing, file writing, or PRs
- No implementation work
- No posting to Slack
- No architectural decisions — surface information, don't prescribe solutions
